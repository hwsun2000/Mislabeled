First of all, simulated data sets can be generated through data_simulated.txt.
 


enetLTS_simulation.R can be used to apply enetLTS to the simulated datasets.



Ensemble_simulation.R can be used to apply Ensemble to the simulated datasets. And rankprodbounds.R is sourced in Ensemble_simulation.R



rlogreg_simulation.m  can be used to apply Rlogreg to the simulated datasets on MATLAB software, and w.mat will be generated, which is the coefficient vector. Then run Rlogreg_simulation.R on R software to evaluate the performance of Rlogreg.
